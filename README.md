# School-Coding-Project
The project is a memory game that flips the tiles when you don't match the correct tiles.
I am currently stuck with an issue where the tiles will show the cards but when they are incorrect they will not flip back (facedown). If anyone is able to help me i would be very appreciative.
I also have a function already built but it wont flip the card when incorrect.
This is the source of where i found the code -  https://pythongeeks.org/python-memory-puzzle-flipping-tiles-game/
